# AWDEO 1738

[AWDEO 1738](https://www.awdeo1738.com) is a stereo system designed for people who can't afford to listen to vinyl as much as they would like.

We love flipping through our record collection. We love listening to great records cover-to-cover. We just can't afford to buy a turntable, preamp, stereo, speakers, and 5 records a day.

AWDEO 1738 simulates the vinyl experience on your computer. You can flip through your records. You can play your records in full. That's it.

Records are organized by artist name. Use your < and > keys to flip through records. Press a letter to jump to a particular artist. Press shift-s to toggle shuffle.
